    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Hello, welcome to BuzzFeeder! This is a website dedicated to keeping a top ten list of
      numbers used by the website Buzzfeed. Basically, my brother and I wanted to figure out what
      numbers Buzzfeed used for their listicles and see if there was a pattern/strategy for it. The
      results below are from a python script I made which crawls through <i>most</i> of the sections
      on Buzzfeed, extracts the titles, and then uses a bash script to count the instances of all
      numbers from 1 - 100. Anyways, hope you enjoy it. If you want to know more about the script/try
      it yourself, check out the github repository <a href="https://github.com/Ortzz/buzzfeeder">
        here</a>.

    <p>This is a list of the top ten numbers used on the website Buzzfeed</p>
    <ul>
      <li>10. The number <b>16</b> with 57 total instances</li>
      <li>9. The number <b>20</b> with 58 total instances</li>
      <li>8. The number <b>11</b> with 66 total instances</li>
      <li>7. The number <b>10</b> with 69 total instatnces</li>
      <li>6. The number <b>23</b> with 80 total instances</li>
      <li>5. The number <b>15</b> with 86 total instances</li>
      <li>4. The number <b>18</b> with 107 total instances</li>
      <li>3. The number <b>19</b> with 122 total instances</li>

    <h2>What It Means</h2>
    <p>I'm not an expert at the analytics behind which numbers get the most clicks/generate the most
      interest, but from the data I am willing to bet that the high teens and early twenties are
      doing really well for the website overall. I mean, the range of numbers in this list is just
      10 - 23. That's just a 13 number split afterall.</p>
    <p>Overtime, I will continue running the script and getting the data. If any additional analysis
      is done with that new data, you will find it here. Thanks for reading this, have an excellent day.</p>
