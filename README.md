# buzzfeeder
Command line tool to tell you instances of a number in most of the sections on the website buzzfeed

This is a project I am working on to help me get started learning python as well as brush up on some of my bash scripting. This is why the final product is ultimately a bash script that calls the python script, makes files with the python script and then uses grep to extract the data and display it in the command line.

I am looking to expand this project in the future by changing the possible output of the tool from not only the number of instances but also allow users to look at percentages. 

I also want to make a site that will take the results from this script and display them for the whole world to view. This will also allow me to continue practicing making sites and work on developing some design sense. 

We'll see where this goes! If you want to run the script yourself, download both the python script and the bash script onto a linux system, and you should also download the requests and beautifulsoup 4 python libraries. Once you have done that, go into your command line, find the directory in which the bash file is located, and run it like you would any other bash script.

Sorry it's not an easy process. I'm still new to this. I hope you enjoy it for what it is anyways and I hope to be back soon with some updates.
